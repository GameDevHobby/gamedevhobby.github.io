# Clone Station Open Beta Now Live on Google Play

I'm excited to announce that the open beta for **Clone Station** is now live on Google Play.

This is a major milestone: World 1 is complete and playable, and the build available in the beta is the first version I'm asking people to test and give feedback on.

## Current state of the build
The version in open beta reflects the work I've been sharing in recent devlogs:
- World 1 is finished with 10 playable levels.
- Several new enemy types have been added to increase variety and difficulty.
- The game has switched to Unity's new Input System, mobile controls now use floating joysticks that follow the player's thumb and gamepad testing is much simpler.
- An early balance pass tuned enemy spawn rates and the star challenges for the first world.
- Some visual and branding updates: a refreshed app icon and updated promotional assets.

## What I want from beta testers
Your feedback will directly shape the next development steps. Useful things to report include:
- Bugs and crashes (how to reproduce them, device model, Android version)
- Gameplay balance issues (levels that feel too easy or too hard)
- Input or control problems (touch, joystick placement, gamepad)
- Performance problems (slowdowns, battery/power issues)
- Anything that felt confusing or unintuitive

Please include steps to reproduce when possible. Screenshots or short recordings are extremely helpful.

## How to give feedback
You can report issues or send feedback here:
- Beta download: [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Polymorphed.CloneStation)
- Bug reports and feedback: [Clone Station Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/P12tiZ3S1D9aoRfV7)  


## What's next
After this beta wave I'll be focusing on:
- Polishing and bug fixes based on tester feedback
- Improving audio and visual combat feedback
- Preparing the store listing and promotional assets for a wider launch
- Continuing level and systems work for subsequent worlds

## Thanks
Huge thanks to everyone who's followed the project so far and to anybody who joins the beta. Your testing, suggestions, and bug reports will make Clone Station better, and I appreciate the time you put into helping shape the game.
